### Quick guide:
- make sure the script is on the ball
- the cups need to be parented to "Parent Of Cups"
- use "UdonBehaviour.SendCustomEvent" set with "Network_RespawnCups" to make the cups respawn
- use "UdonBehaviour.SendCustomEvent" set with "RespawnBall" to make the ball respawn

### Prefab:
- The prefab is pre-setup with a table and 2 sets of cups.
