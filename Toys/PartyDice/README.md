# Party Die

### Fully customizable die
- Bind a Particle System, and/or a Sound Clip to one of the sides of the Die and they will play when rolled
- Outputs it's "Value" to an InputFeild so you can tie other scripts into the die's roll

Due to how the script works, it is recommended to use the Prefab and not the script. Although the scripts are provided if you wanted to try and get it working on your own.
